quickly:

    what is go
        a minimalist programming language created by among others, Ken Thompson, one of the creators of Unix, and creator of B, C's predecessor.
        strongly and statically typed, object oriented (but no inheritance, composition only)
        the spec is 50 pages, and an easy read
        for me, it is a mix between c++ and python. Fast, powerfulâ€”yet simple and readable.

    what is concurrency
        in go concurrency has special meaning
            - design your program as a collection of independent processes
            - design these processes to eventually run in parallel
            - design your code such that the outcome is always the same
            
        the way go decided to do concurrency, is based on the ideas of CSP
            - each process is built for sequential execution
            - data is communicated between processes via _channels_, no shared state
            - scaling means adding more processes

So, what are the primitives

    the `go` keyword
