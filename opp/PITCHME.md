* Not so simple if code rotten

code far beyond your control == _wildly irresponsible_

#### Taking back control
@ul
* Refactor. Add tests.
* Except if API fundamentally broken.

#### Alternative justification for radical refactoring
Success only possible 
* if all sources of complexity is managed (not just technical)
* everyone has sufficient appreciation of both social and technical necessity for control and conformance
